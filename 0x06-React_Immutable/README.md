1. Immutable Objects: Who, What, When, Where, and Why?
Who: Immutable objects are used by developers who want to manage state more predictably and safely, particularly in functional programming and state management contexts.

What: Immutable objects are objects whose state cannot be modified after they are created. Any changes to the object result in the creation of a new object.

When: Immutability is particularly useful when you need to ensure that data does not change unexpectedly, such as in multi-threaded environments, during state management in UI frameworks like React, or in functional programming paradigms.

Where: Immutability is applied in software development, especially in languages and frameworks that emphasize functional programming (e.g., JavaScript with libraries like Immutable.js, Clojure, Haskell).

Why: Using immutable objects helps to avoid side effects, makes it easier to reason about code, enables more predictable debugging, and can improve performance by allowing for structural sharing and efficient memory usage.

2. How to Use the Immutable.js Library to Bring Immutability to JavaScript
Immutable.js is a JavaScript library that provides immutable data structures. Here's a basic usage example:
