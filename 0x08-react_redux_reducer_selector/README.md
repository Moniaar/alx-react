# Redux Concepts and Data Flow

In this section, we explored how Redux can enhance the maintainability of apps by providing a central place for global app state. We also covered core Redux concepts like dispatching action objects and using reducer functions to return new state values.

---

## Conclusion
In this part, we discussed the foundational aspects of Redux and began building a small example application to illustrate how these concepts work in practice. Although the tutorial uses older Redux logic patterns, it serves to explain the principles and concepts behind Redux. For modern applications, it's recommended to use Redux Toolkit. The tutorial provided insights into project setup, initial project exploration, defining requirements, state values, actions, and reducers.

## Key Points
- 🚀 **Redux Central State**: Redux provides a single central place for global app state.
- 🎯 **Core Concepts**: Dispatching action objects and using reducer functions are key concepts.
- 🛠️ **Example Application**: A small example app is built to demonstrate Redux concepts.
- ⚠️ **Older Patterns**: Tutorial shows older Redux patterns, not recommended for production.
- 📚 **Modern Redux**: For modern patterns, refer to Redux Toolkit and the "Redux Essentials" tutorial.
- 🏗️ **Project Setup**: A pre-configured starter project is used, with React and a fake REST API.
- 💡 **State Design**: Focus on designing state values based on app requirements.
- 🔄 **Actions**: Actions are events describing what happened, with a type field and payload.
- 🧩 **Reducers**: Reducers calculate new state values based on current state and actions.
- 🔗 **Combining Reducers**: Combine multiple reducers to handle different parts of the state.
